# Muslim-Brand-Sentiment

# Muslim Brand Index Project


## Summary

The **Muslim Brand Index** aims to track and improve public sentiment towards Muslims in the U.S. by identifying key drivers of perception and implementing data-driven strategies to address them effectively. The process follows a clear framework: **Understand the problem, Identify areas of improvement, and Execute actionable solutions**, while continually refining the approach based on feedback and results.


## Overview

Many Muslims across the United States face ongoing scrutiny, often finding themselves questioned either directly or indirectly about their character, beliefs, and moral stance on sensitive issues. 

A crime committed by one Muslim frequently casts a shadow over the entire community, harming its public perception. 
While various ideas exist on how to shift this negative narrative, they often lack data-driven support. 
To address this, we aim to develop a **Muslim Brand Index** to measure the 'likeability' of Muslims in the U.S. over time. 

This index will provide valuable insights into public perceptions, identify opportunities for positive change, and inform the strategic allocation of capital, talent, and effort to improve the overall perception of Muslims effectively.

## Strategy

The framework  **Understand, Identify, Execute** developed by Facebook's Growth Team, provides a clear path from problem recognition to actionable solutions. Using data-driven insights combined with iterative experimentation the goal is to move from problem to solution in a systematic way

### 1. Understand

- **Analyze the Current State of Muslim Sentiment**: Collect data from various sources, including surveys, social media, news coverage, and community feedback. The goal is to break down the problem into core areas like:

  - **Public Perception**
  - **Media Portrayal**
  - **Community Interactions**

- **Identify Core Metrics & Goals**: Define metrics that can represent sentiment effectively, such as:

  - **Favorability Score**: Derived from survey responses measuring public opinions on Muslims eg. Favorability Score = Sum of All Ratings / Total Number of Responses
    This could help us measure how people feel about Muslims and can highlight shifts in perception over time
  - **Sentiment Analysis of Media Coverage**: Measure how often Muslims are portrayed in a positive vs. negative light
  - **Engagement Metrics**: Assess how Muslims are perceived in day-to-day interactions (e.g. willingness to hire, befriend, or live near). A metric like **NPS (Net Promoter Score)** can be useful here.

- **Track Trends Across Time & Demographics**: Establish a baseline and analyze sentiment across **time**, **geographies**, and **demographics**. Understanding the volatility, evolution, and correlation with world events is crucial.

**Output**: A dataset and visualizations that provide a comprehensive understanding of current sentiment, with the ability to slice the data by geography, demographics, and time.

### 2. Identify

- **Pinpoint Drivers of Sentiment**: Use data analysis to identify the factors contributing to positive or negative perceptions, such as:
  - **Media Influence**: How coverage of events involving Muslims shapes public opinion.
  - **Community Interaction**: The impact of local interactions and relationships on perception.
  - **Stereotypes and Misconceptions**: Identify prevalent stereotypes and their sources.

- **Target Segments for Improvement**: Break down sentiment by demographics, regions, and media sources. Identify which groups have the most unfavorable or favorable views and look for patterns that can guide targeted interventions.

- **Formulate Hypotheses for Change**: Create data-driven hypotheses about what can improve sentiment:
  - **Improving Media Representation**: Work to ensure balanced and accurate portrayal of Muslims.
  - **Promoting Positive Local Stories**: Share local community stories that positively highlight Muslim contributions.
  - **Educational Campaigns**: Address stereotypes and misconceptions through educational content.

---

### 3. Execute

- **Implement Targeted Interventions**: Based on hypotheses, launch initiatives to improve sentiment:

  - **Media Partnerships**: Collaborate with media outlets to promote positive and accurate stories about Muslim communities.
  - **Community Engagement Programs**: Foster interfaith dialogues and community programs to encourage direct interactions between Muslims and non-Muslims.
  - **Content Campaigns**: Develop social media and ad campaigns to highlight Muslim contributions to society.

- **Track, Measure, and Adjust**: Continuously measure the impact of interventions using the **Muslim Brand Index** and refine strategies based on results.
  - **A/B Testing of Strategies**: Test various approaches to determine which interventions are most effective in improving sentiment.
  - **Regular Feedback Loop**: Collect ongoing feedback from stakeholders, communities, and public sentiment data to align actions with goals and make necessary adjustments.
