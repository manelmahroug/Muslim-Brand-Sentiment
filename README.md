# Muslim-Brand-Sentiment

Many Muslims across the United States face heightened scrutiny, often finding themselves questioned—directly or indirectly—about their character, beliefs, and moral stance on sensitive issues. A crime committed by a Muslim individual frequently casts a shadow over the entire community, harming its public perception. While various ideas exist on how to shift this negative narrative, they often lack data-driven support. To address this, we aim to develop a Muslim Brand Index to measure the 'likeability' of Muslims in the U.S. over time.

This index will provide valuable insights into public perceptions, identify opportunities for positive change, and inform the strategic allocation of resources—capital, talent, and effort—to improve the overall perception of Muslims effectively

# Strategy
The framework – Understand, Identify, Execute – developed by Facebook's Growth Team, provides a clear path from problem recognition to actionable solutions, using data-driven insights and iterative experimentation to achieve our goals. 

 1. Understand
- Understand the current state of Muslim sentiment in the U.S. by collecting data from various sources, including surveys, social media sentiment analysis, news coverage, and community feedback. The goal is to break down the problem into core areas like **public perception**, **media portrayal**, and **community interactions**.
- Identify Core Metrics & Goals: Define metrics that can represent sentiment effectively. This could include metrics such as:
"Likeability" score: Derived from survey responses measuring public opinions on Muslims </br>
Sentiment analysis of media coverage: How often Muslims are portrayed in a positive vs. negative light.</br>
Engagement metrics: Measure how Muslims are perceived in day-to-day interactions (e.g., willingness to hire, befriend, or live near). A metric such as NPS can prove useful here </br>

In summary, the key step under this task is defidning a metric that reflects the goal, and start base-lining it across **time**, **across geos**, and **across demographics**. Understanding its volatility, its evolution, and its correlation & sensitivity to various world events is critical. 

The output of this step is a dataset and simple graph visualizations to help us understand the current state of the brand, and slice it across geos/demographics/time.


Sure! Here's how you can apply the Understand, Identify, Execute framework to tackle the issue of tracking and improving Muslim brand sentiment in the U.S.:

1. Understand
Define the Problem Clearly: Understand the current state of Muslim sentiment in the U.S. by collecting data from various sources, including surveys, social media sentiment analysis, news coverage, and community feedback. Break down the problem into core areas like public perception, media portrayal, and community interactions.

Identify Core Metrics & Goals: Define metrics that can represent sentiment effectively. This could include metrics such as:
"Likeability" score: Derived from survey responses measuring public opinions on Muslims
Sentiment analysis of media coverage: How often Muslims are portrayed in a positive vs. negative light
Engagement metrics: Measure how Muslims are perceived in day-to-day interactions (e.g., willingness to hire, befriend, or live near)

Study Historical Trends: Analyze historical trends of sentiment to establish a baseline. This will help in understanding any underlying biases, recurring themes, and factors that have affected perceptions over time.

2. Identify
Next we pinpoint drivers of sentiment: Use data analysis to identify the factors contributing to positive or negative perceptions. These could include:
- Media Influence: Assess how coverage of events involving Muslims shapes public opinion
- Community Interaction: Evaluate how local interactions and community relationships influence perceptions
- Stereotypes and Misconceptions: Identify prevailing stereotypes or misconceptions and their sources
- Target Segments for Improvement: Use our findings to break down sentiment by demographics, regions, and media sources. We will need to determine which groups have the most unfavorable or favorable views and look for patterns that can guide targeted interventions
- Formulate Hypotheses for Change: Create hypotheses about what can be done to positively affect Muslim sentiment, such as:
  - Improving media representation
  - Promoting positive local community stories
  - Running educational campaigns to address stereotypes

  3. Execute
Based on our hypotheses and their outcomes, we launch targeted interventions to improve sentiment. This could include things like:
- Media Partnerships: Work with media organizations to promote accurate and positive stories about Muslim communities
- Community Engagement Programs: Foster interfaith dialogues and community programs that encourage direct interaction and understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims.
- Content Campaigns: Develop social media campaigns or ad campaigns that positively highlight Muslim contributions to society
  
Track, Measure, and Adjust: we continuously measure the impact of your interventions using the Muslim Brand Index and refine strategies based on what is working.
A/B Testing of Strategies: we test different approaches to see which are most effective in improving sentiment.
Regular Feedback Loop: Collect feedback from key stakeholders, communities, and public sentiment data to ensure that actions are aligned with goals and that adjustments are made as necessary.
